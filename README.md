# Traffic Sign Classifier

The Traffic Sign Classifier is a deep learning architecture that visually recognizes traffic signs, trained on the [German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark (GTRSB)](http://benchmark.ini.rub.de/?section=gtsrb&subsection=news) dataset.

For a detailed view of the architecture, its implementation and experimental results, refer to this [notebook snapshot](https://xperroni.github.io/traffic-signs/Traffic_Signs_Recognition.html).
